<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Place the beef bones in a large stock pot, then add enough cold water to cover by 2 inches (5 cm). Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat and cook for 10 minutes to blanch the bones and remove any impurities.</li>
<li>Set a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat the broiler.</li>
<li>Drain the bones in a colander and rinse under cold running water. Return the blanched bones to the stockpot.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, arrange the ginger, garlic, and onions cut-side up on a rimmed baking sheet and broil on high until the aromatics are deeply charred in spots, 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and add to the stockpot with the bones.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, combine the cinnamon sticks, peppercorns, and star anise in a medium skillet over medium-high heat and toast, shaking the pan occasionally, until the spices are darkened in spots and extremely fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add the toasted spices to the stockpot.</li>
<li>Season the brisket liberally with salt and add it to the stockpot.</li>
<li>Fill the pot with enough cold water to cover everything by 1 inch (2 cm). Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium to maintain a gentle simmer, skimming off and discarding any fat that floats to the top as needed, until the brisket is fork-tender, 2-3 hours.</li>
<li>Using tongs, transfer the brisket to a plate and let cool completely. Refrigerate the brisket until ready to serve.</li>
<li>Continue to simmer the broth to get as much flavor out of the bones as possible, 3-4 hours more.</li>
<li>Using tongs, remove and discard the bones and aromatics. Slowly strain the broth through a fine mesh strainer set over a large pot. Skim and discard the fat from the broth, then stir in the fish sauce. Taste and add more as desired.</li>
<li>Thinly slice the brisket. Very thinly slice the raw sirloin steak against the grain.</li>
<li>Divide the noodles among 6-8 large bowls, then top with the brisket and raw steak. Ladle the hot broth over the noodles and meat and serve immediately with the bean sprouts, onion, jalape&ntilde;o, Thai basil, lime wedges, hoisin sauce, and Sriracha alongside.</li>
